# React For Beginners
Today I finished the Wes Bos [React for Beginners Course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) and boy is Wes a Boss. Never heard of him or his super duper course? Check out the details below:

### Who is Wes Bos?
Wes Bos is a Full Stack Canadian Developer, who has taught over 500 students in 200+ classes, plus thousands of developers through online courses/videos. He knows his stuff and he knows how to set developers up for success.

### What is the React for Beginners Course?
It's a fantastic resource that Wes Bos put together for React newbees, which teaches you, through video and corresponding exercises/app build, what React is about.

### How do I get started!

Here's the step process to getting you signed up and set up for the course:

1. Go to <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React for Beginners</a> to sign up.

2. You'll receive an email invite to join the React Course and the Slack channel. Follow the prompts to complete registration.

3. Once logged in to the React course on his website, click on the **Starter Files** link beneath the course description. This will take you to Wes's Github Repo.

4. **Fork** the **React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files** repo, so that you have a copy of the starter files in your GitHub account.

4. Now git clone your forked copy, so that it is local to your computer.

5. From there, change directories into `catch-of-the-day`. You have set up the playground to work in! Niiiiiiice.

6. Now go back to the Wes Bos React Course in the browser and you'll see the option to stream the course videos or download them. You pick!

7. You're set! Jump in.

### Need Help?
No worries, we all do! Within the starter folder, you'll find a `stepped-solutions` folder. Each folder contains the files for the beginning of each video, so if you need any code, pull the appropriate file into your `catch-of-the-day` folder!

### Build Preview
Curious as to what you're building? Check out my version <a href="https://ns-brmardsmyn.now.sh">here</a>. PS - I did not implement authorization and deployed with now.sh.

### Acknowledgements
Wes Bos. Duh.
